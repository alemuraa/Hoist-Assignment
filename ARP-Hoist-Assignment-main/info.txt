First assignment of advanced and robot programming class concerns the development
of a robot simulator which simulates the behaviour of a Hoist.

The repository is organized as follows:
- the `src` folder contains the source code for all the processes
- the `include` folder contains all the data structures and methods used within the ncurses framework to build the two GUIs

After compiling the program other two directories will be created:

- the `bin` folder contains all the executable files
- the `log` folder will contain all the log files of the processes after the program will be executed


To compile:

$ bash compile.sh


After that run the program with the command:

$ bash ./run.sh


----------------------------------SIMULATOR BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------

The hoist simulator has 2 d.o.f. and two different consoles allows the user to activate
the hoist. 
The command console is where the user can give the command to move the hoist along the
two directions, while the inspection console is where the position is printed. In the
inspection console the user can also give two commands one to stop the movement and 
one to reset the position. Other 3 processes are thought to simulate the motors.
There is also a watchdog in the master process  which checks the previous 5 processes periodically, and sends 
a reset in case all processes did nothing for 60 seconds.
Processes communicate using named pipes and signals, everything is managed by the master
process.
